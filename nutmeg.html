        <p> Why should we have a diversity magazine? Initially,
            when I first thought about the question I thought
            the answer was simple: to showcase people from all
            different backgrounds and to give them a platform
            to express their initiatives and ideas. However, as I
            started to discuss this concept with more people, I think
            I realized that although one diversity and inclusion
            magazine will not make a dramatic difference, Nutmeg
            wants to be a platform for BIPOC (Black, Indengenious,
            and people of color), but we do not want to take over;
            we simply want to document and report the feelings
            and current perspectives of BIPOC UConn students to
            our readers. Keeping this edition genuine was one of
            my main goals as editor. Although being affiliated with
            UConn, I will not simply pat UConn on the back for
            doing what most would believe is the bare minimum for
            diversity and inclusion. As UConn students, w e have to
            admit that there is so much underlying racism in our
            community that many like to ignore, and numerous
            incidents like the Charter Oak incident of last year, the
            repainting of the Black Lives Matter rock, and so many
            others are a testament to that. This being said, UConn
            has come a long way in terms of initiatives related to
            diversity and inclusion. Most,if not all, of these have
            been started by students who are pushing and want
            to change this predominantly white institution for
            the better. The initiatives and ideas that are included
            in this magazine such as the creation of the @Black.
            at.uconn Instagram page or numerous organizations
            pushing for a required anti-racism course are actively
            developing and will continue to progress long after
            this magazine is published. Activism that reaches
            outside of the sphere of UConn will continue, and
            it’s our responsibility to keep lighting that fire and
            to keep fighting for what we believe in. It’s also our
            responsibility to educate our family and friends about
            the systemic racism within our country and the racism
            that exists within the UConn community. I hope that
            you as a reader will understand these sentiments and
            educate yourself further on these issues as you read
            this edition on diversity and inclusion. </p>
