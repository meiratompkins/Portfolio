        <p>For my final project, I chose to create a landing page. This landing page changes its background image based on the time of day (either morning, afternoon, and night). It also changes the title to Good morning, afternoon, and night. The background photo is also a randomized photo sourced from Unsplash. Also, by using local storage, you can change the name that is displayed after Good Morning. It also features a clock and a progress bar that goes up as time increases during the day.</p>
